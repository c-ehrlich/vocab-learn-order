- [x] Add "done" button to each card to remove it from the list
- [x] Add a button to the bottom (or hovering?) to add revised word list to clipboard


- [ ] Possible future additions
  - [ ] Filter results by JLPT
    - [*] but... could only work for EITHER exact matches, or match every reading all the time, and neither seems ideal. JLPT lists map somewhat closely to frequency lists so maybe this isn't so important.
  - [ ] Deinflection
    - [*] Could just use Yomichan code (check what license they're using!)
  - [ ] In some edge cases words have duplicate JLPT entries - fix this
    - [ ] The edge case where this seems to appear is words with two different unconventional readings, which both point back to the JLPT level of the common reading - for example 明後日 has "N5 (あさって), N5 (あさって), N3, N1"
    - [ ] This could probably just be fixed in the backend to avoid having to recreate the entire dataset - but fixing it in the backend would be cleaner
    - [ ] check: 明後日 should have 3, not 4 entries

- [ ] Refactoring
  - [ ] Turn removeWord and removeNotFound into one function by using good typescript
  - [ ] Make WordCard and WordCardMini into one component that either takes a variable to know which one it is, or decides itself based on props
